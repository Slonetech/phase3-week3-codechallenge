Restaurant Review System - SQLAlchemy and Faker
This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of a restaurant review system using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Faker. It creates a database, defines three data models (Restaurant, Customer, and Review), generates fake data for these models, and inserts the data into the database.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

SQLAlchemy: You can install SQLAlchemy using pip:

Copy code
pip install SQLAlchemy
Faker: You can install Faker using pip:

Copy code
pip install Faker
Usage
Follow these steps to use the code:

Database Configuration: The code assumes that you want to use an SQLite database named restaurant.db. You can change the database engine configuration in the code to use a different database system.

python
Copy code
# Define the database engine (change the URL as needed)
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///restaurant.db')
Running the Code: There are two code snippets provided. First, run the code that defines the data models (model.py). This code sets up the database tables and relationships.

Copy code
python model.py
Generating Fake Data: After setting up the data models, you can run the second code snippet to generate fake data and populate the database.

Copy code
python generate_fake_data.py
View and Query Data: You can now use SQLAlchemy to query the data stored in the restaurant.db database. Refer to the SQLAlchemy documentation for more information on querying databases.

Data Models
Restaurant
Represents a restaurant entity with columns: id, name, and price.
Has relationships with Review and Customer.
Customer
Represents a customer entity with columns: id, first_name, and last_name.
Has relationships with Review and Restaurant.
Review
Represents a review entity with columns: id, star_rating, restaurant_id, and customer_id.
Has relationships with Restaurant and Customer.
Important Notes
The code snippet that generates fake data (generate_fake_data.py) first deletes all records from the Restaurant, Customer, and Review tables to ensure a clean slate. Be cautious when running this code in a production environment, as it will remove all existing data.

The Faker library is used to generate realistic-looking fake data. You can customize the data generation by modifying the code in generate_fake_data.py.

This code is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for building a more comprehensive restaurant review system. Depending on your requirements, you may need to add more features and functionality to the system.

Feel free to customize and extend this code according to your specific needs. It serves as a basic framework for building a restaurant review system, and you can expand upon it to create a fully functional application with a user interface.
